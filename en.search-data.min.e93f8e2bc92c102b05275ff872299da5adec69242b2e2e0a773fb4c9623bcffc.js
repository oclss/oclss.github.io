Register\n  Future events Several activities have been organized in the past few months, and there are more to come!\nRegular events\n  Monthly seminars\n  We invite two life scientists to give presentations about their research work every month. This month, the presenters are Dr Yiyan Zheng (FER is a plausible novel target for enhancing paclitaxel cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer) and Mr Hanlin Zhang (Autophagy and T cell immunity). They will be presenting at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at 5:30pm on 26 September 2014.\n  Friday tea breaks\n  These tea breaks allow life scientists in Oxford to meet, chat and socialize after a week\u0026rsquo;s hard work. The tea breaks are held at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at 5pm every Friday.\n  Ad hoc events\n Industrial visit We intend to organize an industrial visit to one or two pharmaceutical companies in September/ October 2014.  Past events So far, ten life scientists have presented their work at the monthly seminars (many thanks for their time and effort!):\n  Dr Veronica Chang (Crystallizing a glycoprotein) and Dr Leyuan Bao (VEGF receptor protein-protein interactions and intracellular signalling in human endothelial cells) on 25 April 2014\n  Dr Xiaowei Zheng (Structural biology â€“ see to believe; top) and Dr Wei Gan (Genetic screening for the risk of type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese; bottom) on 30 May 2014:\n  Dr Shan Gao (Searching for synthetic lethality in cancer; top) and Dr Yingjie Wang (To bind or not to bind â€“ hyaluronan and LYVE-1 signalling in lymphatics; bottom) on on 4 July 2014:\n   Dr Joe Zhu (Coalescent trees and population structures; top) and Dr Qianxin Wu (Deciphering microRNA â€“ target regulation using genome engineering approach; bottom) on 25 July 2014:   Prof Tao Dong (IFITM3 rs12252-C is associated with disease severity in pandemic influenza A H1N1/09 infected Chinese individuals; top) and Dr Chang Zheng (What can we learn from observational studies?; bottom) on 29 August 2014:    Barbecue at Wolfson College on 12 July 2014:\n  "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/Jobs/','title':"Jobs",'content':"  Job vacancies Here you can view the job opportunities referred by our members:\n  Various hospital posts - HOT\n  Various hospital posts are available in Beijing for overseas researchers (see here for details).\n  Senior scientist of viral immunology\n  Janssen is looking for a senior scientist of viral immunology to join their R\u0026amp;D centre in Shanghai (see here for details).
