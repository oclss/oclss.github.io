This month, the presenters are Dr Yiyan Zheng (FER is a plausible novel target for enhancing paclitaxel cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer) and Mr Hanlin Zhang (Autophagy and T cell immunity). They will be presenting at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at 5:30pm on 26 September 2014.\n  Friday tea breaks\n  These tea breaks allow life scientists in Oxford to meet, chat and socialize after a week\u0026rsquo;s hard work. The tea breaks are held at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at 5pm every Friday.\n  Ad hoc events\n Industrial visit We intend to organize an industrial visit to one or two pharmaceutical companies in September/ October 2014.
